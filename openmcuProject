Each cxx file has its own properties page. 
When I was building the project, one cxx file included some .h file, which included another .h file that compiler cannot find.
I tried very hard to set include path under the project properties, but not under the specified file.
So I failed.
Remember you can specify include path for every cxx file!!!!
